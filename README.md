# Frontend Mentor – Product Preview Card Component Solution

This is my solution to the **Product Preview Card Component** challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).  
The challenge helped me improve my **HTML, and CSS skills** by building a responsive product preview card component that adapts to different screen sizes and includes interactive hover/focus states.

## Overview
This project is a **product preview card component**, designed to showcase a product (image, title, description, price, call-to-action) in a visually appealing card layout.  
Users can view the card on both desktop and mobile screen sizes, and interact with hover/focus states for the call-to-action and other interactive elements.

The interface features:
- Clean, modern layout with image and information side-by-side (desktop) or stacked (mobile)  
- Hover and focus states for interactive elements (buttons, card actions)  
- Responsive design that adapts to screen width  
- Consistent styling with CSS custom properties for ease of maintenance

## The Challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device’s screen size (mobile vs desktop)
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements  
- Experience a visually accurate representation of the design provided by Frontend Mentor

## My Process
1. Reviewed the design specifications provided by Frontend Mentor and defined breakpoints for mobile and desktop.  
2. Built the semantic HTML structure of the card: image container, text container, title, description, price and call-to-action button.  
3. Applied CSS custom properties (variables) for colors, font sizes and spacing to ensure consistent styling across the component.  
4. Implemented responsive layout using Flexbox (and/or CSS Grid) to switch between stacked layout for mobile and side-by-side layout for desktop.  
5. Added hover and focus styles for the call-to-action button to enhance interaction feedback.  
6. Ensured the card looks and behaves correctly on various screen sizes, refining media queries and ensuring accessibility in interactive states.
